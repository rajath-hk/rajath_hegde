        <p>
          Hello! I'm Rajath Hegde, a passionate Full Stack Developer based in Bangalore, India. With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I create seamless digital experiences that bridge design and functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in tech began with a curiosity for how things work, which led me to explore various programming languages and frameworks. Today, I specialize in building responsive web applications using modern technologies like React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open-source projects, exploring new coffee shops, or hiking in the nearby hills. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy sharing knowledge with the developer community.
        </p>
