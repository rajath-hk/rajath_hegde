# **App Name**: RetroFolio

## Core Features:

- Windowed Sections: Display portfolio sections (About, Projects, Contact) in movable, resizable windows.
- Interactive Desktop Icons: Create interactive desktop icons that, when clicked, open the associated portfolio section in a window.
- Dynamic Taskbar: Implement a bottom taskbar that dynamically displays currently open windows, allowing easy switching between sections.
- Content Display: Load and display content for each section (About, Projects, Contact) within their respective windows.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Retro blue (#4682B4) to emulate classic OS interfaces.
- Background color: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to maintain a vintage desktop environment aesthetic.
- Accent color: Slightly brighter blue (#6495ED) for highlighting active elements.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text. 'Inter' offers a clean, readable, and modern appearance that complements the retro aesthetic, providing a balance between classic feel and contemporary readability.
- Design icons that mirror the style of classic operating systems, using simple, pixelated graphics.
- Mimic the windowing and layout conventions of retro operating systems, including window borders, title bars, and control buttons (minimize, maximize, close).
- Implement basic animations, such as window resizing and opening/closing effects, to simulate the behavior of older operating systems.
